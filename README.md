<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Javascript challenge where I was given a starter code for a simple calender application. The user in mind can be anyone,
but it is designed for someone with a typical working day schedule of 9am - 5pm. 
<br><br>
I was given an HTML/CSS/and Java file that had 9am - 11am. I was tasked with coding the GUI elements and the logic. I also needed to add some save functionality using localstorage. The starter code provided used the Day.js library to work with date and time. 
I was given freedom to use any Javascript solution to handle the functionality. The project was powered by dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

This part of the readme is where community involvement can happen! Normally I would have my Github setup to where anyone can fork and push or make an issue, but 
I am still learning that stuff. In the mean time this is how the section would look like. Pretty much from the Template. <br>

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".


1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Added some Goated new feature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/NewFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
